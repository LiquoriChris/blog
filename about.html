## About

Hi, I'm Chris. I am not a programmer or developer, I am a scripter that enjoys PowerShell and a glass of bourbon. 5 years deep into PowerShell, my primary focus is to create modules to automate pretty much everything I don't like to do manually. Transitioning into the DevOps realm, taking my PowerShell skills, I have been creating Azure DevOps extensions to automate processes in the organization. Aside from working, I enjoy time with my wife and 2 children, and spend as much time as I can golfing, which is not often enough. Enjoy automating and always ask questions. Because no question, is a stupid question.
